        <h4>My Aspirations</h4>
        <ul>		  
         <!-- <li><iframe width="160" height="160" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FEeTLopLkEo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></li> -->
         <li>I'd like to successfully graduate High School and College with complete mastery of the materials taught to me as well a vast understanding of life and the opportunities being offered.</li> 
		 <li>I'd like to become a successful computer engineer and programmer. There are very few people interested in technology in schools, but with our rapidly growing use of technology, it's imperative to have a profession in which technology is mastered.</li>
         <li>I enjoy spending time reading about other engineers such as <a href="http://www.bostondynamics.com/">Boston Dynamics.</a></li>
         <li> My aspirations are not limited to prgramming. I'd also like to become a well rounded artists. Although my drawing skills aren't the best I do hope to use my art in other ways through photography, web design, interior design, and other things of that nature. You can look through some of my photography work on the <a href="index.html">About </a>page.</li>
		 <li> I truly hope to one day change the world for the better and create items of intellect that will not take over the world, but assisst the world and make it a cleaner and friendlier place. (Nothing like <a href="http://www.robocop.com/">Robo-Cop</a>)

        <h4>Places I'd like to Visit</h4>
        <ol><li><h5>SOUTH KOREA:</h5>
		One of many places I would love to visit is Seoul City in South Korea. I'm an enthusiastic fan of KPOP and enjoy the many wonders South Korea has to offer. I enjoy the typical quizine there mainly because of the spiciness of it. The language is different and learning Hongul is a challenge I'm willing to overcome to study abroad there for enginering.
        </li>
         <li> <h5>SOUTH AMERICA</h5>
		 I'd also love to travel through South America and visit place like Leon in Nicaragua, Mexico City, and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. </li>
		 <li><h5>Hawaii</h5> I'd love to visit Hawaii as my first destination by way of airplane. I believe Hawaii could use some more help in keepig its beaches clean which will add to its natural beauty.</li>
		 <li> <h5>France, Italy, Norway, Netherlands, Ireland, New Zealand, and Sydney, Australia</h5> These places would be great places to visit to experiences different ways of life and lessen the burden of consumption Americans experience daily.</li>
